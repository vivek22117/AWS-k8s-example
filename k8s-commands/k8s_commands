When Pods run the output from the containers is captured in
the Pod's /var/log directory. If you know the name of the specific job instance,
the logs command can extract that log. With a little help from grep and c
ut the name of the job is extracted and passed to the logs command:

export JOB_ID=$(kubectl describe jobs oneshot | grep -o 'Created pod: .*' | cut -f3- -d' ')

echo $JOB_ID

kubectl logs $JOB_ID

The log will report 10 new keys were generated.
Once you are done inspecting the Job, use the delete command to remove it:

kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o yaml > pod-definition.yaml

kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=dev
